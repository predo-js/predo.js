We were working on a graphics editor canvas, and they implemented the ability to resize shapes like rectangles and ovals by dragging small handles at their edges.\n\nThe code worked.\n\nBut it was repetitive. Each shape (such as a rectangle or an oval) had a different set of handles, and dragging each handle in different directions affected the shape’s position and size in a different way. If the user held Shift, we’d also need to preserve proportions while resizing. There was a bunch of math."},{"__typename":"DatoCmsCode","id":"DatoCmsCode-4577116-pl","codeContent":"```javascript\nlet Rectangle = {\n  resizeTopLeft(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\n  },\n  resizeTopRight(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\n  },\n  resizeBottomLeft(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\n  },\n  resizeBottomRight(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\n  },\n};\n```"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"DatoCmsArticle-4577114-pl"}}}
